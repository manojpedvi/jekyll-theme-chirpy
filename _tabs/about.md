## Hi there! I am Manoj Pedvi.

Programming is my passion and I work as a software engineer. Iâ€™ve been writing code professionally since 2011. Iâ€™ve been an app developer working for startups and big companies in various domains like banking, healthcare, sports, etc. I started my career as a C#.Net developer and later switched to mobile application development using react native and native Java / Kotlin languages

10x-programming is my weblog I run where I interact with a worldwide community of developers like you, share my knowledge and experience & help you become better developers. I strive to be the best developer I can be and to help others along the road on their learning journey. I consider it a great privilege to be able to help others learn, learn from them, and encourage developers everywhere to be their best.

I know what it takes to become a good developer. I can't wait to share my knowledge with you and help you fast-track your learning. Shoot me an email at [10xprogramming@gmail.com](mailto:10xprogramming@gmail.com) if you have questions, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

## Happy learning ðŸ™Œ
